# Sverchok Scripting

This directory contains some examples of Sverchok scripting:

* `blender_python.sh` — script to run any python script with blender's builtin python
* `generate_api_documentation.py` — script to generate API documentation (similar to what we have in Github Actions, but to launch locally)
* `run_sverchok_script.py` — script to run any python script, which probably uses Sverchok API. Similar to blender_python.sh, but does not depend on OS / shell.
* `script_example.py` — example of script which can be run by run_sverchok_script.py.
