Functionality
-------------

This node allows viewing a list of scalar values and Vectors as a texture, very useful
to display data from fractal, noise nodes and others, before outputting to a viewer_draw_mk2.

Uses OpenGl calls to display the data. This is a very stripped down version of the Texture Viewer node.
